# comments


So **In plain english**, what are comments?
Comments are our opinion or reaction to something. Isn't it? We comment on people's lifestyle, comment on our friend's posts on social media, comment on food we eat, comment on most of the things we come acroos in our everyday life. Same way in python we comment on our code!!!


Comments are basically used to explain the python code that we have written. But usage of it isn't just limited to explain the code. We write comments to make our code more readable. Sometimes we may really don't want to execute some part of the program. So what we just do is make those part of the program as comments, so that we can skip those lines from being executed!

###### How to comment in python
We can create a comment by including '#' symbol before writing a comment. Yes writing a comment is that easy! If anything in the program begins with '#' it is a comment.
```python
#Iam a comment 
#A program to print hello world
print("Hello World!")
```
The output of the above program is just *Hello World!* The rest of the program is a comment !

We can use '#' to prevent some part of the program from being executed.
```python
#print("Hello World!")
#print("Hello Jane") 
print("I love python")
```
The output the above program is just *I love python*
The rest of the code isn't executed at all!

Python ignores strings which are not assigned to a variable, so we can make use of that. We use triple quotes (multilined string) and place our comments inside it.
```python
''' I am also a comment :)
     I love to code.
python is our **HERO**'''
```

So the above lines are also comments. We can use double quotes instead, to create a comment.

Yeah! *Comments* are everywhere, Python ignores it, but we should not!!!:)
