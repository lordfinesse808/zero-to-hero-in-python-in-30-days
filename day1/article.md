### Zero to Hero in Python in 30 days: Day 1: Terminologies and first Python Program
> "Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language." said Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.

Python is a high-level language, it is intended to be able to read and write easily by humans.


Python is an interpreted language. So what is an interpreted language. It means execution takes place line by line. Instructions are executed on the fly. If you have ever worked with languages such as C, Java, C++.. They are compiled languages. That means whole program needs to be compiled before execution. The compiled program outputs the executable machine image noramlly ".exe" in windows and  "a.out" in Linux systems.

If you don't understand some of the terms and concepts please feel free to clear your doubts by mail(contact details are in the previous article).

Python can be executed in two modes:
- Interactive Mode
You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds
- Batch Mode
You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text  editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file(that file is called a Python Script)

Oh! we came across the term text editor. Text editor is a software where you can read and write contents to the file. There are so many text editors available out there. I prefer VSCode.

If you are testing the code or learning something new try the interactive mode, else write a script and run it using python command.

Also there are so many IDE's available out there. IDE stand for Integrated Development Environment. IDE provides some additional features compared to text editors such as code completetion, on the fly error detection etc..

If you want to use a IDE there are several options:
- Spyder
Which is a part of anaconda package
- PyCharm
Developed by JetBrains it is a great IDE but please don't use this if are a beginner
- Komodo IDE
Developed by ActiveState, it is also one of the good IDE for python
- Thonny IDE
IDE for beginners to learn python

As I already said on my first article, my focus is on beginners. So please download and install Thonny IDE. You can download it here(https://thonny.org/). Using thonny you can both execute python using interactive mode and batch mode. Below where we write our first python script(/program) I have attached a screenshot of the IDE itself where you can find these both modes.

If you are an old player of python langauge and know how to use a IDE. Please feel free to use IDE of your choice. If you want to use a text editor then use Visual Studio Code. The benefit of using IDE is that you can run program directly. However I will teach you both ways.

If you are stuck somewhere in the middle, don't stop there, continue reading at some point of time, you will understand what I mean. And nobody knows everything. So please try to google for your queries. Getting answers in google is an art eventually you should learn how to google, i.e, what should I search, what should be the important keywords in my search query so that I get the right results I am looking for. But you can always reach me through mail. I will be more than happy to help you.

I will not introduce the terms you won't suddenly understand. I feel that if you come across terms that you are not familiar with you may lose interest. I am here to make you learn Python easily and build your interest on python. So let's slowly build our concepts one by one.

### First Python Program

Printing **Hello World** is the first program most of the people write when they start learn a new language. Let's not break the approach let us follow it.

```python
print("Hello World !!!")
```
